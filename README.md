# Netflix-TV-Shows-and-Movies-dataset-

Our project centered around a robust and extensive Netflix dataset comprising 5,850+ unique titles encompassing movies and TV shows. Acquired in May 2022, this dataset provided a rich array of attributes including title details, release years, genres, runtimes, IMDb ratings, and more.

WHAT INSIGHTS DID WE AIM TO GAIN WITH THE DATA: 
1. Data Refinement and Preparation with Pandas:
   - Utilized pandas to meticulously clean and preprocess the dataset, employing techniques to handle missing values and refine categorical data.
   - Employed advanced data wrangling methods such as reshaping and grouping to derive insights from a diverse range of attributes.
   - Engineered dummy variables for genres and implemented feature engineering strategies to enhance the analytical potential.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Data Visualization:
   - Employed data visualization techniques, leveraging matplotlib and seaborn, to unveil temporal trends and genre preferences.
   - Conducted statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing and correlation matrices, to unravel complex relationships between variables.
   - Utilized advanced plotting methods to illustrate geographic patterns and audience preferences across diverse regions.

HOW DID WE ACHIEVE GET THE INSIGHTS FROM THE DATA: 
1. Machine Learning Implementation and Predictive Modeling:
   - Applied scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling, constructing models to forecast IMDb ratings based on diverse feature sets.
   - Conducted feature selection and engineered relevant features to improve model performance and interpretability.
   - Employed cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and evaluated model performance metrics meticulously.

2. Advanced Statistical Analysis and Correlation Studies:
   - Utilized inferential statistics and hypothesis testing to ascertain significant patterns in IMDb ratings concerning runtime, genres, and production countries.
   - Conducted advanced correlation studies employing Pearson and Spearman correlations to decipher nuanced relationships between variables.
   - Employed statistical significance tests to validate the observed patterns and correlations, ensuring robustness in our analytical conclusions.

WHAT INSIGHTS DID WE GAIN: 
1. Insightful Discoveries and Predictive Precision:
   - Unveiled the impact of external factors like the pandemic on post-2019 production downturns, using time series analysis and forecasting techniques.
   - Identified multivariate relationships between runtime, genres, and IMDb ratings through advanced statistical analysis.
   - Crafted predictive models with nuanced feature engineering, achieving a 72.08% accuracy in forecasting IMDb ratings over 7, providing a robust tool for strategic decision-making.

2. Data-Driven Decision Empowerment and Future Considerations:
   - Delivered actionable insights into global content preferences, enabling strategic content curation and localization strategies for diverse audience segments.
   - Empowered data-driven decisions, showcasing the potential of predictive models for rating prognostication and audience engagement strategies.
   - Proposed avenues for further analysis, including sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract deeper insights from textual descriptions.
